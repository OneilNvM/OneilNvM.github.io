# Experimental Web Page
##### This is an individually made project on making an interactive website.
##### This was started around 2 or 3 years ago and has gone under a lot of development as I have been learning more about **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and more recently **XML**.
##### A lot of cool things will be added to this website soon.
##### I will post patch notes to update you on what has been changed or fixed.
##### Patch notes will also include bugs that need to be fixed that I am aware of.
